### 2.6 Nested/Local/Inner Classes and Functions 

Nested local functions or classes are fine when used to close over a local
variable. Inner classes are fine.

#### 2.6.1 Definition 

A class can be defined inside of a method, function, or class. A function can be
defined inside a method or function. Nested functions have read-only access to
variables defined in enclosing scopes.

#### 2.6.2 Pros 

Allows definition of utility classes and functions that are only used inside of
a very limited scope. Very
[ADT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_data_type)-y. Commonly used for
implementing decorators.

#### 2.6.3 Cons 

Nested functions and classes cannot be directly tested. Nesting can make the
outer function longer and less readable.

#### 2.6.4 Decision 

They are fine with some caveats. Avoid nested functions or classes except when
closing over a local value other than `self` or `cls`. Do not nest a function
just to hide it from users of a module. Instead, prefix its name with an \_ at
the module level so that it can still be accessed by tests.
