### 2.8 Default Iterators and Operators 

Use default iterators and operators for types that support them, like lists,
dictionaries, and files.

#### 2.8.1 Definition 

Container types, like dictionaries and lists, define default iterators and
membership test operators ("in" and "not in").

#### 2.8.2 Pros 

The default iterators and operators are simple and efficient. They express the
operation directly, without extra method calls. A function that uses default
operators is generic. It can be used with any type that supports the operation.

#### 2.8.3 Cons 

You can't tell the type of objects by reading the method names (unless the
variable has type annotations). This is also an advantage.

#### 2.8.4 Decision 

Use default iterators and operators for types that support them, like lists,
dictionaries, and files. The built-in types define iterator methods, too. Prefer
these methods to methods that return lists, except that you should not mutate a
container while iterating over it.

```python
Yes:  for key in adict: ...
      if obj in alist: ...
      for line in afile: ...
      for k, v in adict.items(): ...
```

```python
No:   for key in adict.keys(): ...
      for line in afile.readlines(): ...
```
