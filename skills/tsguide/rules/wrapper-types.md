### Wrapper types

There are a few types related to JavaScript primitives that *should not* ever be used:

- `String`, `Boolean`, and `Number` have slightly different meaning from the corresponding primitive types `string`, `boolean`, and `number`. Always use the lowercase version.
- `Object` has similarities to both `{}` and `object`, but is slightly looser. Use `{}` for a type that include everything except `null` and `undefined`, or lowercase `object` to further exclude the other primitive types (the three mentioned above, plus `symbol` and `bigint`).

Further, never invoke the wrapper types as constructors (with `new`).
