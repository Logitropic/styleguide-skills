### Use structural types

TypeScript's type system is structural, not nominal. That is, a value matches a type if it has at least all the properties the type requires and the properties' types match, recursively.

When providing a structural-based implementation, explicitly include the type at the declaration of the symbol (this allows more precise type checking and error reporting).

```ts
const foo: Foo = {
  a: 123,
  b: 'abc',
}
```

```ts
const badFoo = {
  a: 123,
  b: 'abc',
}
```

Use interfaces to define structural types, not classes

```ts
interface Foo {
  a: number;
  b: string;
}

const foo: Foo = {
  a: 123,
  b: 'abc',
}
```

```ts
class Foo {
  readonly a: number;
  readonly b: number;
}

const foo: Foo = {
  a: 123,
  b: 'abc',
}
```

Why?

The "badFoo" object above relies on type inference. Additional fields could be added to "badFoo" and the type is inferred based on the object itself.

When passing a "badFoo" to a function that takes a "Foo", the error will be at the function call site, rather than at the object declaration site. This is also useful when changing the surface of an interface across broad codebases.

```ts
interface Animal {
  sound: string;
  name: string;
}

function makeSound(animal: Animal) {}

/**
 * 'cat' has an inferred type of '{sound: string}'
 */
const cat = {
  sound: 'meow',
};

/**
 * 'cat' does not meet the type contract required for the function, so the
 * TypeScript compiler errors here, which may be very far from where 'cat' is
 * defined.
 */
makeSound(cat);

/**
 * Horse has a structural type and the type error shows here rather than the
 * function call.  'horse' does not meet the type contract of 'Animal'.
 */
const horse: Animal = {
  sound: 'niegh',
};

const dog: Animal = {
  sound: 'bark',
  name: 'MrPickles',
};

makeSound(dog);
makeSound(horse);
```
